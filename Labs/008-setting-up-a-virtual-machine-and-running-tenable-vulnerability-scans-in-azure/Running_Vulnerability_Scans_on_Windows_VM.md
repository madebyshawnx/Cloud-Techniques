## Objective
Deploy a Windows virtual machine in Azure and perform vulnerability scans using Tenable to assess system exposure and security posture.

---

## Skills Practiced
- Creating and configuring Azure Virtual Machines  
- Managing Azure resource groups and subscriptions  
- Configuring virtual networks and security settings  
- Running unauthorized and authorized vulnerability scans  
- Using Tenable Vulnerability Management  
- Analyzing vulnerability scan findings  
- Securely connecting to Azure virtual machines

2. **Configured Disk and Network Settings**  
   Selected appropriate disk type and assigned the VM to an existing virtual network and subnet.  
   (Optional screenshot) docs/step-2.png

3. **Validated and Deployed VM**  
   Reviewed configuration settings, passed validation checks, and completed the VM deployment.

5. **Created Basic Network Scan**  
   Configured a new network scan and selected the appropriate scan engine.  
   (Optional screenshot) docs/step-5.png

6. **Captured Target IP Address**  
   Retrieved the VM’s IP address from Azure and defined it as the scan target.

7. **Configured Unauthorized Scan**  
   Launched a credential-less scan to simulate an external attacker probing the system.  
   (Optional screenshot) docs/step-7.png

8. **Configured Authorized Scan**  
   Added valid credentials to perform a deeper authenticated scan of the Windows VM.  
   (Optional screenshot) docs/step-8.png

9. **Launched Vulnerability Scans**  
   Saved and executed the configured scans to analyze open services and system vulnerabilities.  
   (Optional screenshot) docs/step-9.png

10. **Reviewed Scan Results**  
    Examined vulnerability findings, severity levels, and differences between unauthorized and authorized scan results.  
    (Optional screenshot) docs/step-10.png

11. **Verified System Access**  
    Connected to the Windows VM to validate system state and confirm scan accuracy.
