**What this video shows:** Installing AD DS, promoting a server to a Domain Controller, and creating a test user in Active Directory Users and Computers.

---

## Objective
Stand up a simple Active Directory domain on a Windows Server VM and validate it by managing directory objects.

---

## Skills Practiced
- Installing Windows Server roles and features
- Configuring Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Promoting a server to a Domain Controller
- Creating a new forest and domain (example: school.local)
- Navigating Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
- Creating and managing users in Active Directory
- Understanding Organizational Units (OUs) at a high level
- Reconnecting to a server after role installation/reboot

---

## Tools Used
- Windows Server virtual machine
- Server Manager
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
- Remote Desktop (RDP)

## Steps Performed
**1. Access Server Manager** [0:01](https://loom.com/share/3edd30f8c1a948e2b4d482b8c217c1c4?t=1)

![image alt](https://github.com/madebydxgxt/Cloud-Techniques/blob/main/Labs/002-aws-ec2-configure-active-directory-adds/artifacts/1.jpg?raw=true)

- Open the Server Manager on your virtual machine.
- Look for the option to add roles and features.

**2. Add Active Directory Domain Services** [0:11](https://loom.com/share/3edd30f8c1a948e2b4d482b8c217c1c4?t=11)

![image alt](https://github.com/madebydxgxt/Cloud-Techniques/blob/main/Labs/002-aws-ec2-configure-active-directory-adds/artifacts/2.jpg?raw=true)

- Click 'Next' through the initial prompts.
- Select 'Active Directory Domain Services' and click 'Add Features'.
- Continue clicking 'Next' until you reach the installation options.

**3. Promote Server to Domain Controller** [1:08](https://loom.com/share/3edd30f8c1a948e2b4d482b8c217c1c4?t=68)

![image alt](https://github.com/madebydxgxt/Cloud-Techniques/blob/main/Labs/002-aws-ec2-configure-active-directory-adds/artifacts/3.jpg?raw=true)

- After installation, promote the server to a domain controller.
- Choose a domain name (e.g., 'school.local').
- Set a strong password for the domain administrator.

**4. Complete Installation** [2:21](https://loom.com/share/3edd30f8c1a948e2b4d482b8c217c1c4?t=141)

![image alt](https://github.com/madebydxgxt/Cloud-Techniques/blob/main/Labs/002-aws-ec2-configure-active-directory-adds/artifacts/4.jpg?raw=true)

- Click 'Install' to begin the installation process.
- The server will log you out; log back in using the credentials you set.

**5. Access Active Directory Users and Computers** [3:52](https://loom.com/share/3edd30f8c1a948e2b4d482b8c217c1c4?t=232)

![image alt](https://github.com/madebydxgxt/Cloud-Techniques/blob/main/Labs/002-aws-ec2-configure-active-directory-adds/artifacts/5.jpg?raw=true)

- After logging back in, search for 'Active Directory Users and Computers'.
- Open the application to manage users and groups.

**6. Create a New User** [4:48](https://loom.com/share/3edd30f8c1a948e2b4d482b8c217c1c4?t=288)

![image alt](https://github.com/madebydxgxt/Cloud-Techniques/blob/main/Labs/002-aws-ec2-configure-active-directory-adds/artifacts/6.jpg?raw=true)

- Right-click on the desired organizational unit (OU) or domain.
- Select 'New' &gt; 'User'.
- Enter the user's name (e.g., 'John Doe') and login name (e.g., 'JohnDoe256').
- Set a password and configure any additional settings.

**7. Create Organizational Units (Optional)** [6:01](https://loom.com/share/3edd30f8c1a948e2b4d482b8c217c1c4?t=361)

![image alt](https://github.com/madebydxgxt/Cloud-Techniques/blob/main/Labs/002-aws-ec2-configure-active-directory-adds/artifacts/7.jpg?raw=true)

- Consider creating OUs for different departments (e.g., HR, Finance).
- This helps manage users with different account settings.

## Outcome
Active Directory was successfully installed and configured on the VM, and basic administration was validated by creating and viewing directory objects in ADUC.
